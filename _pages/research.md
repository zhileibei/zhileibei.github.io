How can we model biological systems <i>in silico</i>?

Inspired by the successes in natural language processing and computer vision, computational biologists have tried learning analogous representations by treating cells as bags of genes or tissues as images of cells. However, unlike the relatively flat, static structure of sentences or images, biological systems are comprised of multi-scale, dynamic spatial-temporal information flows.

Adding to this intrinsic complexity, further challenges arise from the fact that current technologies usually yield static, single-modal snapshots with limited resolution, incomplete coverage, and high dropout rates. How, then, can we extract the underlying principles of such intricate systems from partial observations?

Motivated by these questions, I am interested in developing multi-modal machine learning methods to learn holistic and meaningful representations of biological entities. I aspire to uncover the mechanisms underlying gene regulation and cell differentiation by leveraging insights extracted from large-scale, integrative data through computational methods and analytical tools, ultimately advancing disease treatments and therapeutics.

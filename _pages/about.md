<!-- I'm a senior undergraduate at **Tsinghua University** in China, majoring in **Computer Science and Engineering**. -->
I'm a first year Ph.D. student at **Massachusetts Institute of Technology** in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. 

Before that, I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from **Tsinghua University** in 2025.

Iâ€™m deeply curious about the mysteries of life, with an aspiration to unravel the complexities of biological systems and drive transformative breakthroughs in healthcare.

I combined my computational background with my passion for biology, focusing on <u>leveraging AI and machine learning techniques to better understand life systems and solve biomedical problems</u>.

Research Interets
======

- AI for Biology
- Multi-modal Machine Learning
- Biological Networks and Systems
- Drug Discovery and Therapuetics
- Interpretability

I am interested in developing **machine learning methods** to **learn holistic and meaningful representations** of biological entities <i>in silico</i>. I aspire to uncover the underlying **regulatory circuits within and between cells** by leveraging insights extracted from large-scale, integrative data through computational methods and analytical tools, ultimately advancing **disease treatments and therapeutics**.
